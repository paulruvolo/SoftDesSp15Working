## Creating, Accessing, and Modifying a Database

For this tool you will be learning how to store and access data remotely.  This structure will be useful for several types of projects:

1. When you want to create an application where a common set of data will be accessed by multiple clients (for instance a web application).
2. When you have data that you want to be persistent (meaning it is maintained across different runs of your program), and you need to organize it and access it efficiently.

There are a multitude of databases out there, but for the purposes of this learning this tool we are going to be focusing on one called "Redis to Go".
